The purpose of this project was to use data from the 2018 and 2017 free agent class to create a model that can predict future free agency classes. 
Data was taken from the advanced stats and points per 100 possession pages of basketball-reference.com.
To create the model both lasso and ridge regression were used.
These models were then used to predict the salary of the 2019 free agent class.
